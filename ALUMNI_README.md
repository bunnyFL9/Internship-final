## üéØ Frontend Integration

The frontend (`index.html`) now uses real data from the API:

1. **Dynamic Loading**: Years are loaded from the API
2. **Interactive Cards**: Click on year cards to see details
3. **Modal Details**: View projects and members for each year
4. **Real-time Stats**: Project and member counts are live

## üìù Sample Data

The seed file includes:
- **6 years** (2020-2025)
- **18 projects** across different categories
- **50+ members** from various universities

### Categories
- Blockchain & Web3
- Cybersecurity & Data Privacy
- AI & Machine Learning
- Web Development & Digital Platforms
- IoT & Embedded Systems

## üîß Adding New Data

### Via API
```bash
# Add a new year
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/years \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"year": 2026, "description": "Future batch"}'

# Add a new project
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"year": 2025, "team_name": "Team New", "project_title": "New Project", "category": "AI & Machine Learning"}'

# Add a new member
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/members \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "John Doe", "year": 2025, "team_name": "Team New", "university": "Universitas Indonesia", "major": "Computer Science", "role": "Developer"}'
```

### Via Database
You can also directly modify the `alumni.db` file using SQLite tools.

## üé® Frontend Features

- **Loading States**: Shows spinner while loading data
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages if API fails
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and hover effects
- **Modal Details**: Rich modal with project and member information

## üîÑ Migration from Old System

The new system is completely separate from the old `server.js`. You can run both simultaneously:
- Old system: `npm start` (port 3000)
- New system: `npm run alumni` (port 3001)

## üì± Usage

1. Start the alumni server: `npm run alumni`
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Click on year cards to see detailed information
4. View projects and members for each year

The system automatically loads real data and provides an interactive experience for exploring ProcodeCG's internship alumni!
